      <description>This article will show many channel use cases
Asynchronous and concurrency programing with Go channels is easy and enjoyable. The channel synchronization technique has wider range of uses and have more variables than the synchronization solutions used in some other languages, such as the actor model and the async/await pattern.</description>

      <description>Wire has two core concepts: providers and injectors.
Providers The primary mechanism in Wire is the providers: a function that can produce a value.
type Foo struct { X int } func ProvideFoo() Foo { return Foo{X: 42} } Providers can also return errors</description>

      <description>Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency primitives make it easy to construct streaming data pipelines that make efficient use of I/O and multiple CPUs. This article introduces what is pipeline, how to to construct a pipeline and introduces techniques for dealing with failures cleanly.</description>

      <description>ReactiveX, or Rx for short, is an API for programming with Observable streams. ReactiveX is a new, alternative way of asynchronous programming to callbacks, promises, and deferred. It is about processing streams of events of items, with events being any occurrences or changes within the system.</description>

      <description>We can simplify the Hive architecture to four components:
The runtime contains the logic of the query engine that translates the SQL - esque Hive Query Language (HQL) into MapReduce jobs that run over files stored in the filesystem.
Storage component is simply that, it stores file in various formats and index structures to recall these files (JSON, CSV, ORC, Parquet, HDFS, Aws S3, GCS)</description>

      <description>gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.
In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create disitributed applications can services.</description>

      <description>Protocol buffers provide a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in a forward-compatible and backward-compatible way. It&amp;rsquo;s like JSON, except it&amp;rsquo;s smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings.
Protocol buffers are a combination of the definition language (created in .</description>

      <description>Channel is an important built-in feature in Go. It is one of the features makes Go unique. Channel makes concurrent programming convenient, fun and lowers the difficulties of concurrent programming. Channel mainly acts as a concurrency synchronization technique. To understand channels better, the internal structure of channels and some implementation details by the standard Go compiler/runtime are also simply described.</description>

      <description>Fan-in Fan-out is a way of Multiplexing and De-Multiplexing in golang. Fan-in refers to processing multiple input data and combining into a single entity. Fan-out is the exact opposite, dividing the data into multiple smaller chunks,

      <description>Generator Pattern allows the consumer of the data produced by the generator to run in parallel when the generator function is busy computing the next value.
A Future indicates any data that is needed in future but its computation can be started in parallel so that it can be fetched from the background when needed.</description>

      <description>I used to think real men subclassed everything. That was until I learned the power of extension at runtime, rather than at compile time.
Just call this chapter &amp;ldquo;Design Eye for Inheritance Guy.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll re-examine the typical overuse of inheritance and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to decorate your classes at runtime using a form of object composition.</description>

      <description>Trino is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources.
Since Trino is being called a database by many members of the community, it makes sense to begin with a definition of what Trino is not.</description>

      <description>Keeping your Objects in the Know, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out when something interesting happens.
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.</description>
