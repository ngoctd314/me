      <description><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ve got a pipeline set up. Data is flowing through your system beautifully. Sometimes, stages in your pipeline can be computationally expensive. When this happens, upstream stages in your pipeline can become blocked while waiting for your expensive stages to complete.</p>
<p>One of the interesting properties of pipelines is the ability they give you to operate on the stream of data using a combination of separate, often <strong>reordered</strong> stages. Maybe that would help improve the performance of the pipeline. In fact, it turns out it can, and this pattern has a name: fan-out, fan-in.</p>
<h2 id="fan-out">Fan out</h2>
<p>Fan-out is a term to describe the process of starting multiple goroutines to handle input from the pipeline.</p>
<p>You might consider fanning out one of your stages if both of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t rely on values that the state had calculated before.</li>
<li>It takes a long time to run. (system call, a heavy cpu job, &hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../images/fanin-fanout/fan-out.png" alt="fan-out"></p>
<p>The property of order-independence is important because you have no guarantee in what order concurrent copies of your stage will run, nor in what order they will return.</p>
<h2 id="fan-in">Fan in</h2>
<p>Fan-in is a term to describe the process of combining multiple results into one channel.</p>
