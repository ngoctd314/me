(system call, a heavy cpu job, \u0026hellip;) the property of order-independence is important because you have no guarantee in what order concurrent copies of your stage will run, nor in what order they will return.\nfan in fan-in is a term to describe the process of combining multiple results into one channel.\n","title":"Fan out, Fan in"}]
